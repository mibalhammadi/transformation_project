# 2D Coordinate System Transformation

## Overview

This Python library performs a series of 2D transformations on a set of points, including translation and rotation transformations using matrix operations. 

## Features

- Define a 2D point (`Point2D`)
- Translate points using a translation matrix (`Translate`)
- Rotate points using a rotation matrix (`Rotate`)
- Combine translation and rotation transformations (`Transformation`)

### Running Tests

To run the project and see different points get transformed, use the following:

```
python3 -m transformation_project
```

To run the tests, navigate to the project root directory and use the following command:
```
python3 -m tests.__main__
```
